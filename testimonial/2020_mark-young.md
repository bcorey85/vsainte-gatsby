A local business sponsored Vlad's visit to our rural Iowa school and it was a great visit. Vlad gave his presentation and read his book to our students and they had a great time interacting with him. Vlad's book is relevant to students of all ages and my students were excited to read his book again. Our district has a large Hispanic population and the themes of his book touched them in a positive way. Thanks for the opportunity to meet a positive author who obviously cares about kids.
