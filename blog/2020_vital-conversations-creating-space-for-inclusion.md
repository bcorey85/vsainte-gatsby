Jarrod Sanderson and I were able to collaborate and create an outstanding presentation on creating safe space for having important conversations around race and inclusion. I would like to thank Encore Institute for Social Impact and Resolve Counseling, for providing me this opportunity to continue the work. 

 \*\*Due to copyright issues a section of this presentation had to be deleted - a segment from the Netflix special, Derren Brown: Sacrifice played from [18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nguSwl8QLY&t=1118s) â€“ [25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nguSwl8QLY&t=1504s). It is recommended you watch this section on your own.
