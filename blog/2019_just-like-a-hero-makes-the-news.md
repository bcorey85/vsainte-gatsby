Local news station KSHB just ran a story about the mission of Lead to Read KC.*Just Like A Hero* makes a quick little sneak appearance at around 1:07. See if you can spot it! I just want to give a shout out to everyone that has helped make this dream a reality and spread the word about my book. Thank you all!
