I was recently interviewed by KCUR 89.3/NPR on their Central Standard show, discussing the importance of mental health and diversity in children's literature and my *Just Like A Hero* book series. Check out the article and give it a listen!

I would also like to thank Lead to Read KC for seeing the value in my work. If you haven't heard of them, please check them out at [LeadToReadKC.org](https://www.kcur.org/post/kansas-city-childrens-book-author-gives-kids-hope-shields-and-other-emotional-super-hero-tools?fbclid=IwAR2xch3AOy050DzPCXzXjqJlri5FIpSOhw2GUNYv0IAf0haaXOKOWu3OVic#stream/0). This year, I will be partnering with them again to read my second children's book,*It Will Be Okay*, at several KC schools to improve the emotional literacy of youth.
