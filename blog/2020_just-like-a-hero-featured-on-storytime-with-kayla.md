During an author book tour in Chicago, I met Kayla Spears, who runs her own YouTube Channel called Story Time with Kayla. I was moved and impressed by her personality and entrepreneurship that I handed her a copy of *Just Like A Hero*. She saw the value in my work and featured it in her latest episode. Check out the video and her [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCurGE5lEY_pyXEIanQxFO1g).
