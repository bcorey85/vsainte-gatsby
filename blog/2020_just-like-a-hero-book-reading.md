With all of us staying at home, I thought I would read my debut book, *Just Like A Hero*. This story is about a young black boy named Will, who is struggling with some negative views about himself, but throughout his journey learns how to share his feelings and become the hero he is inside. During this stressful time, remember we can be heroes for ourselves and for our kids! Come up with your own superpowers and share them as a family.
