Hi everyone! I just wanted to share the teaser trailer for my upcoming book, *It Will Be Okay*. I hope you all enjoy! *It Will Be Okay* is about a young girl named Alma, who is burdened by anxiety, fear, and bullying. In this story, Alma learns steps to mastering her anxieties, while battling her Fear Monster named Limbo. Along the way, Alma uncovers the embodiment of all her strengths, the Hope Shield, and finds the path to becoming her own true hero.
