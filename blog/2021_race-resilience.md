I was fortunate and blessed on having the opportunity to present with my dear friend Jessie Turner on understanding the dangers of not addressing racism in early childhood. We discussed tools (i.e., children's books, videos, activities) that promote character development in children.  We tackled conversation on disrupting the preschool to prison pipeline.
