Check out what KCPT – Kansas City PBS had to say about my recent author visit: “Local author and social worker Vladimir Sainte shared his book *Just Like a Hero* with students at Kansas City's Citizens of the World Kansas City during their weekly Lead to Read KC program. Inspired by the story, students share how they manage angry, sad or frustrated feelings.”
