I was honored to be featured in an email by Lead to Read again. Check out what they had to say!

"Lead to Read KC is excited to partner with local children’s therapist and author Vladimir Sainte for a second year to help promote coping skills and self-esteem among our students. Sainte’s book *It Will Be Okay* brings a message of hope about overcoming bullying, anxiety and fear. His book *Just Like a Hero* teaches personal values and challenges negative thoughts.\
\
Each of our teaching partners will receive one of Sainte’s books and a teaching guide, and each of our students will receive a book. We are organizing author visits to a number of our partner schools. Watch for more details soon via email and our social media!"
