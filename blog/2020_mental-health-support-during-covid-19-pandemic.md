I was recently contacted by the host of KCUR's Central Standard, to provide insider professional knowledge on mental health resources within the Kansas City community to support families during the COVID-19 crisis. Please remember that we are all in this together, and to seek support if you are experiencing any distressing feelings or thoughts. Eventually, this crisis will pass, and *It Will be Okay*!
