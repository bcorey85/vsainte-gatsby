I’m very excited to announce that I will be a guest speaker for the 25th Annual Sally Price Social Work Conference at Saint Luke’s Hospital, which will be held on Saturday April 4th. This year, the conference will be hosted in a “TedX” style presentation. There will be two speakers for each of the 6 tenets of social work. My speech will focus on the social Work core value; dignity and worth. Come check it out! I just realized this event is less than two months away. I should probably start working on my speech![😬](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f62c).....yikes!!!
