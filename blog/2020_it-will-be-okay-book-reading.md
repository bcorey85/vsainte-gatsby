Hi everyone, I just posted a personal reading of *It Will Be Okay* on YouTube this afternoon*.* I created this book to help support children's mental health in a way that's fun and easily accessible for them. *It Will Be Okay* is designed to tackle themes of overcoming fear, anxiety, and bullying, which makes it a great resource for parents, teachers, and other mental health professionals who work children experiencing stressful moments. I hope you enjoy!
