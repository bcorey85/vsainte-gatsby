It was great bringing my diverse books of resiliency and hope to such a collective group of young individuals. Big thanks to Green Belt Bank and Trust, Iowa Falls PTO, and especially Kim Hartford for seeing the value in my work and providing the opportunity to share Will and Alma's story. I can now check off Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa, only 47 more states to go until world domination!!!",
